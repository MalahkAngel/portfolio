					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p class="info">I have been fascinated with computers since I was old enough to use them. When I got my first video game console, 
					after the novelty of having a new toy subsided my first thoughts revolved around how it worked. I even went
					as far as calling Sega's customer support hotline to ask. The person I spoke with was as helpful as they could
					have been, but even the trivial explanation they were able to give me sparked further intrigue in my young mind.</p>
					<p class="info">When I got my first Windows 98 machine in 1999 that intrigue finally took form. I along with a few friends
					began dabbling with an open source game development program called "RPG Toolkit". The interesting thing about this
					program was that it not only had support for user-made plugins written in C++ (which at the time I was blissfully
					unaware of) but utilized its own rudimentary programming language called "RPGCode" for organizing and scripting.</p>
					<p class="info">Though my friends and I never managed to pull together a complete game, the experience stuck with me and of all
					things inspired me to try my hand at learning web design. I built my first simple website at 14 utilizing basic
					HTML. From there I learned about BBS software such as phpBB and vBulletin and dabbled in the former, learning more
					about server-side programming and server maintenance in the process. I took what I had learned and began building
					websites for friends and family and on occasion would get paid for my efforts.</p>
					<p class="info"> I graduated high school in 2004 a few years after the dotcom bubble burst. Not seeing a future in web
					development, I opted instead to pursue a degree in Human Service and Psychology--the latter being another subject
					I found fascinating. After a few years working towards that, familial obligations found me both sidelined and
					relocated to Texas, followed by Oregon. Upon moving to Oregon I realized that the tech industry had stabilized
					and thus took the opportunity to dive back into my true passion. I enrolled at Eastern Oregon University in 2013
					pursuing a degree in Computer Science which I am on the cusp of acheiving.</p>
					<p class="info"> In 2017, I encountered back-to-back family tragedies. Both of my parents were diagnosed with cancer. My
					mother was diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer in June 2017 and 2 weeks after her passing in August 2017, my
					father was diagnosed with a grade 4 glioblastoma on his basal ganglia. He passed in February of 2018. My brother
					and I took care of both of them through these tribulations and as a result I ended up taking a year off from
					school. However in 2018 I resumed my studies and will be graduating in June 2019.</p>

					more complex topics taught in both Java and C++ ranging from data structures and algorithm analysis to
					object-oriented programming and collaborative efforts. Electives taken included 3D modeling, web authoring,
					database management, and x86-style assembly. Other program requirements included various levels
					of math including Trigonometry, Calculus, Discrete Math, and Linear Algebra. Electively took courses of higher
					level Calculus, Physics, and Abstract Math. Opted to minor in Spanish, having completed the necessary
					coursework and having passed the ACTFL oral proficiency exam proving an adequate level of fluency.</p>

					<h2>Emotacolor | February 2017 - June 2017</h2>
					<h2>Mobile App Developer</h2>
					<h3>La Grande, Oregon</h3>
					<p class="info">Co-developer of a prototype for an SMS app designed to facilitate easier
					communication between autistic children and their parents / teachers. The app allowed background
					of messages sent to be adorned with subtle color variations to indicate the child's mood.
					Also contained metrics with regard to number and type of messages sent for parents to track
					their child's moods and what may have triggered them over time. Sadly, after the prototype was
					completed and delivered, the patron of the project abandoned it and demanded all code
					produced during development be turned over to them for unexplained reasons.</p>

					<h2>mpZero Studios | May 2015 - November 2015</h2>
					<h2>Full Stack Web Developer | Mobile App Developer</h2>
					<h3>La Grande, Oregon</h3>
					<p class="info">Built, designed, and managed websites for various firms both local and distant.
					Majority of clients were real estate firms. Duties included routine Apache server maintenance,
					database management, page layout and design adhering to responsive design methodologies, debugging,
					and development of MLS search engines comparing local databases to nationwide databases. Other clients
					included local businesses such as bakeries and coffee shops. Duties for these clients were often
					limited to design and maintenance. A brief foray into mobile app development using an intermediary
					called PhoneGap was attempted prior to the company collapsing due to a waning demand for new local
					clients in rural Oregon. Duties for all tasks were relegated and timetables established in a daily
					SCRUM. Highlights include development of a released Self-Employment Tax Calculator Android App, and
					a revamp of an MLS search engine that became the company standard for further engine development.</p>
