# portfolio
This repository is meant to serve as my online portfolio for work I've done across various disciplines.

// Intro //
=
This section contains what amounts to an interactive resume as well as a demonstration of my responsive design skills.
It consists of one page made with HTML/CSS and jQuery and displays all of the information contained in my resume as well
as additional information less fitting for such a document. It has two page layouts utilizing media queries and flexbox.
One is optimized for larger screens, the other for mobile and tablet screens.

// NESPong //
=
This section contains the .asm files used to create a Pong clone for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was created
on the foundation of bunnyboy's Nerdy Nights tutorials available on the Nintendo Age website. It can be assembled and
tested using NESASM3 and the FCEUX SP emulator.

// 2D Platformer //
=
This section contains a proof of concept for a 2D platformer in the vein of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. This is
more to demonstrate my grasp of object-oriented programming than a exhibition to be tested. It was created using Visual
Studio 2017 and the Allegro 5 2D graphics library and written in C++.

// Java Coursework //
=
Various short programs written for CS classes at Eastern Oregon University provided to demonstrate my familiarity with Java
and in one instance SQL integration within Java.

// Psuedo Map Editor //
=
A simple visual map editor for the 2D Raycaster in development. Allows the user to modify 32 x 32 grids representing wall types and texture IDs, then save them in a format readable by the main game engine that I've dubbed the Psuedo Engine (given the psuedo 3D produced... yes I know I'm lame and derivative hush). 

// x86 Assembly //
=
Various code snippets displaying my ability to understand low-level concepts in a more modern (by comparison) assembly language.

--Coming Soon--
// 2D Raycaster Maze //
=
This section contains a proof of concept for a raycaster maze in the vein of Wolfenstein 3D. This is to demonstrate my
understanding of low-level operations using C++ as the code is written to quickly edit individual pixels in a pixel buffer
by altering the colors of the buffer rather than drawing pixels directly. This was necessary as since Allegro went from
version 4 to version 5, it became hardware accelerated and thus software-based routines such as pixel drawing became much
slower given the introduction of support for pixel shaders. This is also meant to show my appreciation for old-school
development techniques.

// Spaced Out!! //
=
Another homebrew NES game, this time in the vein of Galaga and other arcade-style spaceship shooters. This is my capstone
project for my Computer Science degree and thus is a bit more complex and involved than my Pong project.
